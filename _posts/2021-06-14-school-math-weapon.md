*The following text is part of a series of texts generated by OpenAI's GPT-3, a deep learning model for natural language processing.They are not just any texts, they seek to explain something. What I try to do is combine concepts and see how the model relates them and generates new ideas.Basically, I only indicate to the model the phrase written in "input". Everything else is generated by the model*

This text is one of the most incredible. How it generates a common thread from the teaching of a simple calculator in school to how mathematics can become a lethal weapon, being taught and promoted with the mere intention of beating everyone else (as if it were a weapon). What seems incredible to me is how the model understands the concept of "lethal weapon" in the figurative sense (not as a physical item, but as an analogy to something terribly harmful) so as to relate it to mathematics. Truly amazing.
