*The following text is part of a series of texts generated by OpenAI's GPT-3, a deep learning model for natural language processing.They are not just any texts, they seek to explain something. What I try to do is combine concepts and see how the model relates them and generates new ideas.Basically, I only indicate to the model the phrase written in "input". Everything else is generated by the model*

<b>Input: The following is a text that talks about whether everyone suffers from sadness (and hapiness).</b>

<b>What is happiness?</b>
The exact meaning of happiness is still not clear. In general, it may be understood as the state of a person who has power, prosperity, honor, and is not suffering from any sickness.

<b>Type of sadness</b>
There are two types of sadness. One is the sadness that we feel as a result of a loss. The other is the sadness that we feel when we are not satisfied with, or do not have something that we want.

<b>What do we feel when we are sad?</b>
We feel very depressed and have a feeling that everything around us has gone wrong. We feel tears of sadness in our eyes, and our heart beats very fast. We have an impulse to cry, but we hold it in. We feel like we are in pain, and we want to run away from the situation.

<b>What should we do when we are sad?</b>
After realizing that you are sad, you should be honest to yourself and realize the reason why you are sad. Once you understand the reason why you are sad, you can think about the solution to get out of this situation.

<b>What do we feel when we are happy?</b>
When we are happy, we feel very comfortable and experience a pleasant feeling of joy. We feel like everything around us has gone right. We feel like our lives are flowing smoothly. We feel that our hearts are beating slowly. We feel that we are full of energy and have a cheerful mood.

<b>What should we do when we are happy?</b>
After realizing that we are happy, we should try to maintain this feeling and not let it go. We should do things that make us happy and think about the things that we have that make us happy.

<b>How do we distinguish between happiness and sadness?</b>
Sometimes, we may feel both happy and sad at the same time. To distinguish between happiness and sadness, we should see whether or not we have the energy to do things. If we feel like we have the energy to do things, then we may be happy. If we do not have the energy to do anything, then we may be sad.

<b>What are the differences between happiness and sadness?</b>
Happiness and sadness are two feelings that everyone will experience, whether they want to or not. They are both feelings that we will experience in life. Happiness and sadness are both important and both should be enjoyed.
